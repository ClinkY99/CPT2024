## In Pursuit Of Ignorance

Hello And thank you for looking at our small game demo "In Pursuit Of Ignorance", This was created for the purpose of learning among the 4 members of our project. This project was also submitted for the Basilian STEM Awards, and won first place in the contest.

### How To Play

Once you have run the In Pursuit Of Ignorance Installer you will be able to run In Pursuit Of Ignorance like any other game. 

**Controls:**
- Left Click on objects to Interact
- Right click to close out of objects & Puzzle Menus
- WASD to move around

When solving the puzzles within this game do not look at the other players screen, instead try to describe what you see by looking at the information on your screen. I know some of the puzzles will be confusing, and I am very sorry for that, we are still working on this!

### How To Multiplayer!

Start up the game on 2 different computers on the same network, Have one person host, and the other person will click join game. The game should appear within the menu there, based off the origional game. Once the other player has joined the game will automatically progress Into the next phase

#### PLEASE NOTE:
If at any point, one player loses connection both games will crash
